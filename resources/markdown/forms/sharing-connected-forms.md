# Sharing Connected Forms

The Share Connected Forms feature allows you to share related forms with others while you're still completing a form. This is especially useful for workflows where multiple people need to provide information about the same event or situation.

## When to Use This Feature

This feature is helpful when:

- You're filling out an incident report and need witness statements from others
- You're completing a primary form and others need to fill out related follow-up forms
- Multiple people need to submit information linked to the same event

## How It Works

When you're filling out a form that has connected forms:

1. **Look for the Share link** - While completing your form, you'll see a "Share" link near the top of the form alongside other options like "View Blank Form"

2. **Open the Share panel** - Click the Share link to open a panel showing all connected forms

3. **Share with others** - For each connected form, you can:
   - Click the arrow icon to open the form in a new tab
   - Click the QR code icon to display a scannable code others can use with their phone camera

## Benefits

- **Work in parallel** - Others can start their forms immediately without waiting for you to finish
- **Pre-filled information** - Connected forms automatically receive relevant data from your form (like date, location, or other shared details)
- **Mobile-friendly** - QR codes make it easy to share forms with people who have their phones handy

## Requirements

To use this feature, your form setup must meet these conditions:

- **Datasource configuration** - Your form must be set up as a "datasource" form. A datasource form is one that shares its data with other connected forms. This configuration is done by your administrator in the form builder settings.
- **Connected forms exist** - At least one other form must be linked to your datasource form to receive shared data. These connected forms are configured by your administrator.
- **Active submission** - You must have started (but not necessarily completed) your form submission. The Share link appears once you begin filling out the form.
- **Parent submission only** - This feature is only available on the original (parent) submission. If you're filling out a connected form that was shared with you (a child submission), you won't see the Share option—only the person who started the original form can share connected forms.
