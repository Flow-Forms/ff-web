# Sections

Long forms can feel overwhelming. Sections let you break your form into logical groups, displayed as tabs that guide respondents through one topic at a time.

For example, a job application form might have sections for "Personal Details," "Work Experience," and "References" - each appearing as its own tab.

## Creating a Section

To create a section, select any field in your form and look for the **Section** setting in the field properties panel. Enter a name for the section - this name will appear as the tab label your respondents see.

Any fields with the same section name are grouped together. To add more fields to an existing section, simply assign them the same section name.

Fields without a section assigned will appear in an "Other" tab at the end of your form.

## Organizing Your Sections

Sections appear as tabs in the order determined by their first field. To reorder sections, drag the first field of a section to a new position in your form.

Keep related fields together within each section. A good rule of thumb: each section should cover one topic or step that makes sense on its own.

**Tips for effective sections:**
- Use clear, concise tab names (e.g., "Contact Info" not "Please Enter Your Contact Information Here")
- Aim for 3-7 fields per section - enough to feel substantial but not overwhelming
- Put the easiest section first to build momentum

## How Respondents Navigate Sections

When your form has sections, respondents see tabs at the top. They can click any tab to jump directly to that section.

The **Next** button at the bottom of each section validates the current section before advancing. If required fields are missing, the form highlights them and keeps the respondent on that section until they're complete.

When a respondent clicks Next on the final section (or if all required fields are complete), the form submits.

**What respondents experience:**
- Progress bar shows completion across all sections
- Clicking a tab switches sections instantly
- The form only submits when all required fields in all sections are filled
