# Form Builder

The Flow Forms builder provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating forms without any coding knowledge.

## Getting Started

To create a new form:
1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Click "Create a New Form" 
3. Give your form a name
4. Start adding fields from the left panel

## Building Your Form

### Adding Fields
Fields are available in the left sidebar. Simply click or drag any field type to add it to your form:
- Each field requires a name
- Mark fields as required using the toggle switch
- Configure field-specific settings in the properties panel

### Arranging Fields
- Drag fields to reorder them
- Fields automatically stack vertically
- Use the Group field type to create multiple columns

### Field Configuration
Every field has common settings:
- **Field Name** - The label users see
- **Required** - Toggle to make the field mandatory
- **Help Text** - Add instructions below the field
- **Placeholder** - Example text shown in empty fields

## Form Options

Access additional settings through "Additional Form Options":
- Set up user groups who can view submissions
- Configure form behavior
- Enable special features

## Saving and Publishing

Forms auto-save as you build. When ready:
1. Click "Save" to finalize your form
2. Use the preview button to test your form
3. Get your embed code or share link

## Tips for Success

- Start simple and add complexity gradually
- Use clear, descriptive field names
- Test your form before sharing
- Group related fields together for better organization
