# Form Tagging

Tags help you organize and categorize your forms. Use them to group related forms together, making it easy to find what you need when you have many forms.

## Why Use Tags?

- **Organization** - Group forms by project, department, or purpose
- **Quick Filtering** - Instantly find all forms with a specific tag
- **Flexible** - Add multiple tags to a single form
- **Shared** - Reuse the same tag across different forms

## Adding Tags to a Form

1. Open your form in the builder
2. Click "Additional Form Options" to open the settings panel
3. Scroll to the "Tags" section
4. Click "Add Tag" to expand the tag input
5. Start typing a tag name
6. Select an existing tag from the dropdown, or press Enter to create a new tag
7. The tag appears on your form immediately

You can add as many tags as you need to a single form.

## Creating New Tags

Tags are created on-the-fly as you type:

1. Click "Add Tag" in the form options
2. Type your new tag name
3. Press Enter or click "Create [tag name]" in the dropdown
4. The new tag is created and added to your form

New tags become available for use on any of your other forms.

## Removing Tags from a Form

To remove a tag from a form:

1. Open the form in the builder
2. Go to "Additional Form Options"
3. Find the tag you want to remove
4. Click the X button next to the tag

Removing a tag from a form doesn't delete the tag itself. The tag remains available for other forms.

## Filtering Forms by Tag

On your forms list, you can filter to show only forms with a specific tag:

1. Look for the tag filter buttons above your forms list
2. Click on any tag to filter your forms
3. Only forms with that tag will be displayed
4. Click "All Forms" to clear the filter and see all your forms again

The selected tag appears highlighted to show which filter is active.

## Searching by Tag

The search bar finds forms by both name and tag:

1. Type a tag name in the search bar
2. Forms with matching tags will appear in the results
3. This works alongside the tag filter for even more precise searches

## Tag Colors

Each tag is automatically assigned a color based on its name. The color stays consistent everywhere the tag appears, making it easy to recognize your tags at a glance.

Colors are assigned automatically—you don't need to choose or configure them.

## Tips for Effective Tagging

- **Be consistent** - Use the same naming convention for similar tags
- **Keep it simple** - Short, descriptive tag names work best
- **Don't over-tag** - A few meaningful tags are better than many vague ones
- **Reuse tags** - Search for existing tags before creating new ones
