# Security at Flow Forms

At Flow Forms, security is fundamental to everything we do. We implement enterprise-grade security measures and follow industry-standard frameworks to protect your data and ensure reliable service delivery.

## Security Framework

Flow Forms implements security controls based on the **CIS (Center for Internet Security) Controls**, a globally recognized cybersecurity framework designed to protect organizations against the most common cyber attacks. This framework ensures we maintain comprehensive security practices across all aspects of our operations.

## Infrastructure Security

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Our application infrastructure is hosted on AWS, which provides enterprise-grade security and compliance. AWS maintains certifications including SOC 1/2/3, ISO 27001, PCI DSS Level 1, and FedRAMP authorization. You can review AWS's complete security documentation at [aws.amazon.com/security](https://aws.amazon.com/security).

Flow Forms employs the following security measures to protect our AWS infrastructure:
- Access to production systems is strictly limited to authorized personnel only
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all production access
- Production data access is logged and monitored
- Infrastructure access keys are regularly rotated

### Database Security with Neon Postgres
We use Neon Postgres for our database infrastructure, which provides:
- **SOC 2 Type 2** compliance
- Automatic encryption at rest using AES-256
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.2+
- Database connection pooling with secure authentication
- Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- Database branching for secure development workflows
- Network isolation and private database endpoints

### Content Delivery with Cloudflare
Cloudflare protects and accelerates our application with:
- **SOC 2 Type 2** and **ISO 27001** certifications
- Advanced DDoS protection and web application firewall (WAF)
- SSL/TLS encryption for all data in transit
- Bot protection and rate limiting
- Global anycast network for performance and reliability
- Security analytics and threat intelligence

## Application Security

### Data Protection
- **End-to-end encryption** for all sensitive data using industry-standard AES-256 encryption
- **Encryption in transit** using TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Encryption at rest** for all stored data including databases and file storage
- **Secure password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Data minimization** practices - we only collect and store necessary information

### Access Control & Authentication
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** available for all user accounts
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with principle of least privilege
- **Session management** with secure session tokens and automatic timeouts
- **Strong password requirements** with complexity validation
- **Account lockout protection** against brute force attacks
- **Secure password reset** processes with time-limited tokens

### Application Security Measures
- **Input validation and sanitization** to prevent injection attacks
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** protection on all forms
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** prevention with output encoding
- **SQL injection prevention** using parameterized queries and ORM
- **Secure headers** including HSTS, CSP, and X-Frame-Options
- **Regular dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
- **Automated security testing** integrated into our development pipeline

## Development & Operations Security

### Secure Development Lifecycle
- **Code review requirements** for all changes before deployment
- **Automated security scanning** using GitHub Advanced Security
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** with automated updates
- **Static application security testing (SAST)** in our CI/CD pipeline
- **Container security scanning** for our deployment images
- **Infrastructure as code** with version control and audit trails

### Access Management
- **Principle of least privilege** for all system access
- **Multi-factor authentication** required for all administrative access
- **Regular access reviews** and deprovisioning procedures
- **Audit logging** for all administrative actions
- **Encrypted communication** for all internal systems
- **VPN access** required for sensitive infrastructure

### Monitoring & Response
- **Automated security monitoring** with real-time alerting
- **Application performance monitoring** for anomaly detection
- **Error tracking and logging** for security event analysis
- **Vulnerability scanning** with automated dependency updates
- **Backup and recovery procedures** with regular testing

## Data Privacy & Compliance

### Data Handling
- **Data classification** policies for different types of information
- **Data retention policies** with automatic deletion procedures
- **Backup encryption** for all data backups
- **Secure data disposal** when information is no longer needed
- **Privacy by design** principles in all feature development

### Employee Security
- **Security training** for all team members
- **Confidentiality agreements** for all staff
- **Secure development practices** and code review requirements

## Continuous Improvement

We continuously enhance our security posture through:
- **Regular security updates** and dependency management
- **Security best practice adoption** and framework compliance
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** and remediation
- **Security metrics tracking** and monitoring

## Transparency & Communication

### Security Incident Response
In the event of a security incident, we:
- **Immediately contain** and address the issue
- **Notify affected customers** promptly
- **Provide regular updates** during resolution
- **Conduct post-incident analysis** to improve our security
