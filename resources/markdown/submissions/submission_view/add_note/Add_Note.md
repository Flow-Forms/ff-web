# + Add Note -
Add additional information, comments, or attach files for the record. Notes are visible to anyone with access to the submission, but can be set to "protected" when you need only a group of users to be able to view them. The "+ Add Note" button appears at the bottom of each submission's window and also in the header when in expanded view.

To add a note:
1. Click the "+ Add Note" button and a modal window will appear over the top of the submission.
	- If other notes have already been submitted, the most recent will appear in a grayed out box that says, "Most Recent Note," along with the name of the user that submitted it and how long ago it was added. *If the displayed note is of a certain length, it will appear truncated with the option to select a "+ read more" and, conversely, a "- read less" button for you to toggle between according to your preference.*
	- If more than one note has been added, there will be a button at the top of the modal that gives you the option to "{{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} View All Notes." If you want every note to be displayed for your review, click "{{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} View All Notes." A slide-out column will present from the right side of your screen that lists all the notes, along with their submitter's name and the time of the note's addition, in order, with the most recent addition at the top.  Click the "X  Close" button in the top right corner of the slide-out to return to your "Notes" modal window.
2. Next, you can optionally select permitted users to be notified of your notes addition.
	- By default, the person that was the form's submitter will be selected for notification when a note is added, and their name and email address will be displayed in the dropdown box under the label, "Notify Selected Users."
	- If you click the box, the dropdown will display all users that are included in the flow-steps for that form, along with a search bar. Scroll through, or search, for the user/s you would like to add or remove.
	- Clicking any user's name will add a checkmark beside their info to indicate they have been selected for notification.  If you do not wish to notify a user that is selected, click their name to unselect them, and the checkmark will disappear.
	- If there are no users selected for notification, the drop down box will display "No Users."
3. After that, proceed to the "Message" text box and input your note content.
	- You can additionally select the "{{icon:folder-plus size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Attach File" button, located just above the right side of the "Message" text box, and choose files from your device to attach to your note.
		- Once an attachment is uploaded, it will appear below the "Message" text box, under "Attachments." The attachment can be downloaded by clicking its link. You also have the option to delete the attachment by clicking the red, trash can ({{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}) icon.
4. When your note is complete, click the blue, "Add Note" button to submit. Any users selected for notification will be sent an email notifying them of your note addition at this time.
	- If you need to navigate away from the notes modal, and would like to return to submit your note later, click the "Save Draft and Close" button.
	- If you have chosen to save your draft, your note, as you left it, will reappear in the "Notes" modal window when you click the "+ Add Note" button on that submission again.
	- Clicking out of the modal, or clicking the "X" in the top, right-hand corner of the modal, exits you out of the "Notes" modal without submitting your note. However, your note will still be saved as a draft and accessible in the same manner as a draft.
	- To discard/delete a note that you have not submitted, click the "Discard Draft" button in the bottom, left-hand corner of the modal.


- When viewing a full submission on its own page (from the "{{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out)" option), "Notes" appear in a column to the right of the submission data window with the most recent note displayed at the top. Click the "+ Add Note" button to contribute a new note.
	- This view also includes the option to "hide notes" by clicking that link just above the notes column. When notes are hidden, an "{{icon:eye size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}" button will appear in the upper right corner. Click this button to show the notes column again.

- **{{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} View All Notes** - displays all notes submitted along with user name and time stamp. This button will appear beside the **+ Add Note** button at the bottom of the submission's window when other notes exist.

- **Deleting Your Notes** -  When viewing all notes from the slide-out column, or the {{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out) view, any note you contributed will appear with a trash can ({{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}) icon beside it that allows you to delete any note you contributed. Admin can also delete notes added by any user.
