## Search Bar
The search bar ("{{icon:magnifying-glass size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Search submissions (⌘K)") takes up the most space on the submissions management panel. To search your submissions for a keyword, phrase or number, click anywhere inside the search bar or press the "Command / ⌘" + "K" keys to see your cursor appear within the search bar and begin typing. 

When you use the search bar to filter your displayed submissions, the search function compares your input to any one element (or field) that is on a form and displays every submission that contains that matching element, as you typed it, but is not case-sensitive. The portion you searched for will appear highlighted in blue. Search cannot be depended upon to produce any results that are *close* to what you typed if there is a misspelling or if only part matches.

By default, your search results are displayed in order by the submission that has had the last action taken (this can be altered in "Filters", under "Sort By"). 

If you have other filters, like "Status" or "Form," selected, it will only search and produce results for those filtered categories. *So, be sure to clear your filters before a new search.*

**Common Search Bar "Gotchas"**
- Commas, decimals, apostrophes, and other punctuation - these are passed over in the search. For instance, searching for 36.00 will also produce results like, 3600 or 3,600.
- Your search input spans multiple elements of a form. A submission element, or form element, is each individual input box that is on a form to receive the submission data. If you search a phrase that, on the form, is divided out into multiple input boxes, your search may not deliver all the results you are looking for.  
	
	*An example of this:* You enter "Billings, MT" into the search bar. Your search results will only include those submissions that have a submission element that contains, "Billings, MT" in one input box. But, it would not include those submissions that contain one form element of "Billings" and/or a second form element that is "MT."
- What you searched for isn't highlighted anywhere on the presented submission results. This is probably because your *Display* option is set to "Collapse All" and the form element that matches your search is only visible in expanded view. Select the "Expand All" display option from the submissions management panel, or click "show more" in the individual submission's header.
- Did we mention that you should make sure your filters are cleared before starting a new search? :) The most common reason to not receive the proper search results is that you have a filter set that you didn't realize was still active, therefore limiting your search's data set.

### Submission Count 
When viewing the submissions management panel with your filters cleared, the total number of submissions that include you will be displayed at the right end of the search bar. This "Submission Count" is the total number of submissions that apply to you and are available to you for search/filter. Every filter that is applied that excludes submission criteria from your search will be reflected in the submission count that is displayed. Your submission count is also displayed when accessing the "Filters" menu.
