## Search Bar
The search bar ("{{icon:magnifying-glass size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Search submissions (⌘K)") takes up the most space on the Submissions Control Panel. To search your submissions for a keyword, phrase or number, click anywhere inside the search bar or press the "Command / ⌘" + "K" keys to see your cursor appear within the search bar and begin typing. When no other filters are active, all submissions available to you will be included in your search results when utilizing the search bar filter. To search with more specificity, you will likely want to utilize additional [filtering](Submissions/Filters) options. 

When you use the search bar to filter your displayed submissions, the search function compares your input to any element (or field) that is on a form and displays every submission that contains that matching element, as you typed it. It is not case-sensitive. The portion that matches what you entered into the search bar will appear highlighted in blue on each submission result. The search function cannot be depended upon to produce results that are *close* to what you typed if there is a misspelling. 

By default, your search results are displayed with the submission that has had the most recent action taken (or "status update") at the top, and on, in descending order to the oldest submissions. *This sort order can be altered in "[Sort Submissions](Submissions/Display_Options#Sort%20Submissions) {{icon:bars-arrow-down size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}" within the control panel.*

If you have other filters, like "Status" or "Form," selected, it will only search and produce results for those filtered categories. *So, be sure to clear your filters before a new search.*

**Common Search Bar "Gotchas"**
- Commas, decimals, apostrophes, and other punctuation - these are passed over in the search. For instance, searching for 36.00 will also produce results like, 3600 or 3,600. 
- What you searched for isn't highlighted anywhere on a presented submission result.  This could be because your [display](Submissions/Display_Options) option is set to "Collapse All {{icon:arrows-pointing-in size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}" and the form element that matches your search is only visible in expanded view. Select the "Expand All {{icon:arrows-pointing-out size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}" display option from the submissions control panel, or click "{{icon:arrows-pointing-out size-5 inline-block align-text-center}} show more" in the individual submission's header. Another reason could be that the search result was not an exact match to what you typed in the search bar (the previously mentioned punctuation could be to blame).
- Did we mention that you should make sure your filters are cleared before starting a new search? :) The most common reason to not receive the proper search results is that you have a filter set that you didn't realize was still active, therefore limiting your search's data set.

### Submission Count 
When viewing the submissions management panel with your filters cleared, the total number of submissions that include you will be displayed at the right end of the search bar. This "Submission Count" is the total number of submissions that apply to you and are available to you for search/filter. Every filter that is applied that excludes submission criteria from your search will be reflected in the submission count that is displayed. 

If your submission count displays a "0," there are no submissions to display that fit your criteria. Make sure to "Clear Filters" to be certain previously used filters are not active and limiting your search field. 

Your submission count is also displayed, at the top of the slide-out menu, when accessing the "Filters."
