# Filters
Flow Forms provides comprehensive filtering options to find exactly what you need.  Utilizing filters to limit your displayed submissions allows you to take care of common tasks together, efficiently locate data, run reports, and much more.

To access the complete filter menu, start from the "{{icon:paper-clip size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Submissions" page, and click the blue "{{icon:adjustments-horizontal size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Filter" button in the submission management panel. A slide-out menu will present from the right side of the screen. If any filters are currently active, there will be a "Clear All" button available at the top. Clear the filters if you are starting a new search to be certain previous filtering choices are not active and limiting your search results. Your [[#Submission Count|Submission Count]] is also displayed at the top of this menu, beside "Filters," and will adjust in accordance with any filtering options you select. If your submission count displays "0" there are no submissions that fit your search criteria.

Apply multiple filters simultaneously to narrow your search results. Choose to filter with any of these options:
- Forms
- Terms
- Flow Step
- Date Range
- Status
- Submitted By
- Pending On
- Participants

Once all filtering selections are complete, click the blue, "{{icon:funnel size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Apply Filters" button at the bottom of the menu. Either click on the submissions page that is in the background (off of the slide-out menu), or click the "X" in its top right corner, to exit the "Filters" menu and view your specified submission results.

### Forms

Display and search only the submissions from selected forms. Select the form/s to include in your search from the drop-down box that says, "Select forms to filter," or type the form's name/title into the search bar, which will appear within the drop-down box, and select from the results. A check-mark will appear beside any form that is selected for filtering. To un-select a form, click it a second time and the check-mark indicator will disappear. 

After your desired form/s are selected from the drop-down menu, the number of forms you've selected for search are displayed in the drop-down box.

*The "Forms" and "Status" filters are both enabled with "[[Quick-Filter\#Quick-Filters]]" access. When a form is selected as a filter, that form's title will also appear on the submission management panel, beside "{{icon:document-duplicate size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Forms," located just below the left end of the search bar. From the submission management panel, you then have the option to click the "X," listed with that form title, to cease filtering by that form.*



### Terms

Choosing to filter by "Terms" allows you to display submissions that have a particular response to a specific form element. 
To do so, you must first select to filter by that [[#Forms|form]]. When at least one form is selected, "Terms" will appear as a filtering option just below the "Forms" drop-down box. When you click, "Add Term," a new drop-down box presents every form element that is included in the form/s you have selected. 

When a form element is selected from the drop-down list, you will only be searching that selected form element for your specified term. Your search will not include any data that is received from any of the other form elements. 

If the form element is a text input, a box for you to type the term you wish to filter for will appear that says, "Enter search value." 
If it is a radio, select, or checkbox style form element, then the box will be a drop-down (with search option) that contains the input options available for that specific form element.

Once the term or terms are specified, click the blue "+ Add Term" button and your criteria will be displayed, listing both the form element you selected and the term you entered. These can be cancelled by clicking the "X" beside your term selection, or by clearing the filters.

*For example:*  I have selected a form called, "Client List," from the "Forms" filter option. So, when I click "Add Term"  and select the drop-down box, every form element that is on the "Client List" form, such as: Business name, Contact name, Phone number, Address, etc., appears as an option.  If I select the form element, "Address," and then type, "Montana," in the new text box that appears, I am selecting for my search results to display only clients that have "Montana" in the address category.



### Flow Step
If you would like to filter to display only the submissions from a form that are on a specific step in their workflow, you will choose to filter by Flow Step. 

First, you must select to filter by [[#Forms|form]]. When at least one form is selected, "Flow Step" will appear below the "Terms" filter option within the "Filters" menu. Clicking the drop down box will present you with a numbered list of every flow step, from the selected form, in the order they occur. Click on a flow step to select it for filtering, and a checkmark will be displayed on its left. Click again to unselect. Multiple flow steps can be selected at the same time. Once selected, the flow step's title will be displayed in the drop down box, or, if two or more are selected, the number of flow steps chosen for filtering will be displayed.



### Start date / End date
To see the submissions from a certain period of time, choose to filter by date. From the filter menu, click in the box below "Start Date," where the current date is displayed in gray, and either type in the 8 digit date (2 digit month, 2 digit day, 4 digit year), or select the date from the calendar, that marks the beginning of your search range.
Repeat the same process in the "End Date" box to mark the end of your desired search range. 

The submissions displayed will be based on the date they were submitted. 

*If you have a form that has a date as one of its form elements, such as, "Invoice date," and would like to filter for that, you will need to use the "[[#Terms|Terms]]" filter instead.*



### Submission Status 
Display and search submissions that share the status or statuses you select.

As a submission moves through its workflow toward completion, its status reflects that progress. Each status is represented by a color. Not every status is utilized in every form, but the exhaustive list is as follows: 
		
- Blue - **Approved** (submission is complete)
- Yellow- **Pending** (waiting on another's action)
- Red - **Pending on Me** (waiting on your action)
- Orange - **Sent Back** (submission has been sent back to the form's originator)
- Magenta - **Info Requested** (sent back to any flow-step for additional information)
- Gray- **Denied** (submission has been rejected and cannot be continued)
- Teal - **Escalated** (skipped flow-step(s) to seek input/approval)

Select by clicking in the box beside any status. A checkmark will be displayed when a status is selected, and multiple may be selected.  Click the box a second time to unselect. With this filter active, your search results will only display submissions that correlate with the statuses selected.

*"Status" and "Forms" filters are both enabled with "[[Quick-Filter\#Quick-Filters]]" access. When "Status" is selected as a filter, the status' name (along with a corresponding color dot) will appear on the submission management panel, beside "{{icon:funnel size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Status," located just below the right end of the search bar. From the submission management panel, you then have the option to click the "X," listed with that status, to cease filtering by that form.*


### Submitted By

To display only the submissions submitted by a specified user or users, utilize the "Submitted By" filter option.

From the blue, "Filters" button, scroll down to "Submitted By" and click its drop down bar that says, "Search by name or email."  A list of users accessible to you within your organization will load below with a search bar at the top. Begin to type the name or email of a desired user into the search bar and click their info line to select them as they appear. A green checkmark will appear beside their email address, if selected, which you may click again to unselect. All selected user names will appear listed just above, along with a red "X" that you can click if you want to remove their submissions from your filtered search results.

By default, the list of users that populates in the drop-down will only include those with Flow Forms user accounts within your organization. There is, however, a toggle switch just below the drop down box, with "show external" beside it, that, when selected, allows you to also search and select names and emails of users that have submitted into your Flow Forms data set from an *external* form link. Activating this switch would be of use if you need to search for data submitted by a user that filled out a public-facing form for your organization.


### Pending On

To display the submissions that are pending on a specific user or users, click the blue, "Filters" button, and scroll down to "Pending On." Click the drop down that says, "Search by name or email," and a list of users accessible to you within your organization will load below with a search bar at the top. Begin to type the name or email of a desired user into the search bar and click their info line to select them as they appear. A green checkmark will appear beside their email address, if selected, which you may click again to unselect. All selected user names will appear listed just above, along with a red "X" that you can click if you want to remove their submissions from your filtered search results.

By default, the list of users that populates in the drop-down will only include those with Flow Forms user accounts within your organization. There is, however, a toggle switch just below the drop down box, with "show external" beside it, that, when selected, allows you to also search and select names and emails of users that have submitted into your Flow Forms data set from an *external* form link. This search addition would come in handy if you need to search for data submitted by a user that filled out a public-facing form for your organization.

### Participated In Submission

To only show submissions to forms that include a designated user or users, at any point in the workflow, you can specify this with the "Participated in Submission" filter. 

From the blue, "Filters" button slide-out menu, scroll down to "Participated in Submission."  Click the drop down that says, "Search by name or email,"  and a list of users accessible to you within your organization will load below with a search bar at the top. Begin to type the name or email of a desired user into the search bar and click their info line to select them as they appear. A green checkmark will appear beside their email address, if selected, which you may click again to unselect. All selected user names will appear listed just above, along with a red "X" that you can click if you want to remove their submissions from your filtered search results.

By default, the list of users that populates in the drop-down will only include those with Flow Forms user accounts within your organization. There is, however, a toggle switch just below the drop down box, with "show external" beside it, that, when selected, allows you to also search and select names and emails of users that have submitted into your Flow Forms data set from an *external* form link. This search addition can be used to search for data submitted by a user that filled out a public-facing form for your organization that does not have an internal Flow Forms account for their use.



### Saved Filters

For frequently accessed search criteria, you have the option to save a filter and name it accordingly. Follow these steps to create reusable filters:
1. **Make your filtering selections** - Utilize any or all of the above mentioned filters.
2. **Click "{{icon:bookmark size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Save Current Filters"** - This option displays at the top of the "Filters" slide-out menu after a filter is selected.
3. **Name your filter**- Enter your choice for the filter's name in the text box that appears next.
4. **Click "Save"** (or cancel to exit without saving) - Refresh your page, after saving, to view the newly added filter.
5. **Access saved filters from the main sidebar** - Your new filter's name will appear under the "{{icon:funnel size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Filters" section when clicked. The listing of your saved filters is presented alphabetically, is scrollable for users with more than four filters saved, and also contains a search bar. You can dispose of unwanted filters by clicking the red trash can ({{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}) that is to the right of your filter's name. A pop-up window will ask, "Are you sure you want to delete this filter?" Click "OK" to proceed with deletion, or "Cancel" to exit.


## Clear Filters 
Any time a filter of any type is active, the option to *"Clear Filters"* will appear on the submission management panel, to the right of the *"Filters"* button, beside the search bar. Clicking this removes **all** active filters (including in your search bar) and restores the presentation of the full list of submissions available to you. 

Since Flow Forms saves and displays your last filter selections on your "Submissions" page, the option to "Clear filters" is also available from the main sidebar, beside "{{icon:paper-clip size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Submissions," if you wish to clear your filters at the onset of loading your submission page.


## Quick-Filters
Two of the most commonly used filters, *"Forms"* and *"Status,"*  are easily accessible from their links on the submission management panel. 

"{{icon:document-duplicate size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Forms" is located just below the search bar on its left side. To filter by form, click to show a drop down menu with search option. All your forms are listed in alphabetical order and can be scrolled through or found by searching for the form title. Click to select the form or forms you would like to include in your search. A checkmark will appear to the left of any form you have selected. If no form is selected as a filter, submissions from every form will be included in your displayed results.

"{{icon:check-badge size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Status" is located below the search bar, but on its right side. To filter by a submission's status, click to see every status option listed (color coded) with a select box to the left of each. Click in the box of any status, and a checkmark will indicate its selection. Click the checkmark to unselect that status from your filtered results. If no status is selected, submissions of every status will be included in your displayed results.

When "Forms" or "Status" filters are active, their name will appear listed on the submissions management panel, below the search bar, on their respective sides, with the option to "X" out of any that you would like to remove from filtering.

When viewing a full submission from the "Pop-out" option, *Notes* appear in a column on the right of the submission data with the most recent at the top. This view also includes the option to "hide notes.") 
	- *When adding a note, you can optionally select permitted users to be notified of your addition. If you do not wish to notify a user that is selected, click their info from the dropdown to unselect them. If there are no notifications selected, the drop down box will display "No Users." You can also save your note as a draft and close*
- "View all notes" button - displays all notes submitted along with user name and time stamp (appears beside the "Add Note" button at the bottom of the submission's window when other notes exist).
