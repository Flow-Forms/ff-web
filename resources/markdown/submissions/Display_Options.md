## Display Options
The submissions management panel includes clickable icons that allow you to switch between two display options as well as change the sort order of your displayed submissions. These are found on the right side of the management panel below the "{{icon:adjustments-horizontal size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Filters" button and beside the "{{icon:check-badge size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Status" quick-filter button. *(Directly below "Clear Filters" when a filter is active.)*


### Sort By {{icon:bars-arrow-down size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}
**Updated (Default) -** The default sort order will display your submissions with the  submission that has had the most recent update to its status at the top, and so on in that order down the page. 

**Created Date -** 



### Expand All {{icon:arrows-pointing-out size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}
	
Fully display all of the submission's data including an expanded view of  attachments in some formats (png, jpeg). 


### Collapse All {{icon:arrows-pointing-in size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}

Display an overview of the submission's elements that have been selected as pertinent at the time of the form's creation. This view option displays attachments as thumbnails and/or viewing links. 
	


***Note** - You can change the view of an individual submission rather than apply that view to the whole page. Expand an individual submission that is collapsed by clicking the "show more" button in that submission's header and, conversely, collapse an expanded submission by clicking its "show less" button. 
Additionally, see "Show More" button and "Show Less" button in the Submission View section below.*
