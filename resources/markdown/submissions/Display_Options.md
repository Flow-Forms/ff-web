## Display Options
The submissions header also includes two clickable icons to switch between two display options:
### "Collapse All" {{icon:arrows-pointing-in size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}

Display an overview of the submission's elements that have been selected as pertinent at the time of the form's creation. This view option displays attachments as thumbnails and/or viewing links. 
	
### "Expand All" {{icon:arrows-pointing-out size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}
	
Fully display all of the submission's data including an expanded view of  attachments in some formats (png, jpeg). 

*Note - You can change the view of an individual submission rather than apply that view to the whole page. Expand an individual submission that is collapsed by clicking the "show more" button in that submission's header and, conversely, collapse an expanded submission by clicking its "show less" button. 
Additionally, see "Show More" button and "Show Less" button in the Submission View section below.*
