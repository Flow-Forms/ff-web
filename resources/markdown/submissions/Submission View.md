# Submission View

Navigate to any of the entries that have populated below the Submissions Management Panel to view individual form submissions.

## Submission Header
The header of every individual submission displays:
- Form Title/Name - click to start a new submission of that form type 
- Name of the submitter
- "Edit" icon - if permission to edit is allowed, you may alter the inputs and add data/comments to the submission
- "History" button - View every action that has been taken on that submission so far. *You may also choose to "show conditional steps" for a more in-depth insight into the flow's parameters (not interesting to most of us)* 
- Status of the submission - if not "Approved," it will list on whom it is pending
- Time the submission was created
- Time the submission was last updated
- Gear icon for "Options" -
- "Pop-out" {{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} - fully view a single submission on a reloaded page.
- "Show More" button - fully view all data/entries on the form while remaining on your "Submissions" page. Also referred to as *Expanded View*
	- *Most attached documents (ex: .png, .jpeg) will also expand in view. PDFs will display a "view PDF" link in order to view the attachment in a modal window. Alternatively, you can click the attachment's link below it to download the attached document or photo.*
- "Show Less" button - return to the overview display of that submission (appears when in the expanded/"show more" view). Also referred to as *Collapsed View*
- "+ Add Note" button - add additional information, comments, or attach files for the record. (Button appears at the bottom of each submission's window and also in the header when in expanded view. When viewing a full submission from the "Pop-out" option, *Notes* appear in a column on the right of the submission data with the most recent at the top. This view also includes the option to "hide notes.") 
	- *When adding a note, you can optionally select permitted users to be notified of your addition. If you do not wish to notify a user that is selected, click their info from the dropdown to unselect them. If there are no notifications selected, the drop down box will display "No Users." You can also save your note as a draft and close*
- "View all notes" button - displays all notes submitted along with user name and time stamp (appears beside the "Add Note" button at the bottom of the submission's window when other notes exist).
