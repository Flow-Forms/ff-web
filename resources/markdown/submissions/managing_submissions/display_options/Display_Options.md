# Display Options
The submissions management panel includes clickable icons that allow you to switch between two display options as well as change the sort order of your displayed submissions. These are found on the right side of the management panel below the "{{icon:adjustments-horizontal size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Filters" button and beside the "{{icon:check-badge size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Status" quick-filter button. *(Directly below "Clear Filters" when a filter is active.)*


## Sort Submissions {{icon:bars-arrow-down size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}
Click the "Sort Submissions" button and your options will appear in a drop-down box. The default settings show they are selected by a checkmark. Click any of the other options to select them instead.

### Sort By

- **Updated Date (Default) -** The default sort order will display your submissions in reference to the date that it last had an update to its status. This is by an action being taken on that submission such as an Approval, Denial, Info Request, etc.

- **Created Date** - Choosing to sort by "Created Date" will order your submissions by the date that the submission was initiated. 

### Direction

- **Newest First (Default) -** The default sort order is to display submissions with the most recent date listed first, then in descending order to the oldest.

- **Oldest First -** To view submissions in the reverse order, with the oldest submission at the top and newest last, select the "Oldest First" direction. 

## Expand All {{icon:arrows-pointing-out size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}
	
Fully display all of the submission's data including an expanded view of  attachments in some formats (png, jpeg). 

## Collapse All {{icon:arrows-pointing-in size-5 inline-block align-text-center}}

Display an overview of the submission's elements that have been selected as pertinent at the time of the form's creation. This view option displays attachments as thumbnails and/or viewing links. 




***Note** - You can change the view of an individual submission rather than apply that view to the whole page. Expand an individual submission that is collapsed by clicking the "show more" button in that submission's header and, conversely, collapse an expanded submission by clicking its "show less" button. 
Additionally, see "Show More" button and "Show Less" button in the Submission View section.*
