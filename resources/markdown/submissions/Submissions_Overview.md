# Somehow I Manage... Submissions

View, organize, and manage form submissions efficiently with Flow Forms' powerful submission management tools.

All form submissions that you have permission to access are available to view from the "Submissions" page. Click "{{icon:paper-clip size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Submissions" from the sidebar to begin.

*Note - It is also an option to click "clear filters" when accessing the Submissions page from the sidebar. Flow Forms automatically saves and displays your last search and/or filtered result, making for easy access to frequently needed info. If you know you are starting a new search, clicking "clear filters" from the sidebar is a time-saving nicety that prevents having to "Clear Filters" after your submissions page loads.*

## Management Panel
At the top of your submissions page is the Submissions Management Panel that will remain at the top of the display as you interact with your submissions down the page. This space contains the search bar and all the filter functions, export and print options, as well as the controls to change the display view. The bottom of the management panel is made up of the "Bulk Actions Toolbar" that allows you to take actions for a group of submissions rather than dealing with them individually.  

Below the management panel, an abbreviated display (20 entries per page) of **all** form submissions you are authorized to interact with is listed, in order, by the submission that has had the most recent action taken. This is by default, and can be filtered for viewing in many ways. You may change the list order in "Filters" under "Sort By."

### Search Bar
The search bar ("{{icon:magnifying-glass size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Search submissions (⌘K)") takes up the most space on the submissions management panel. To search your submissions for a keyword, phrase or number, click anywhere inside the search bar or press the "Command / ⌘" + "K" keys to see your cursor appear within the search bar and begin typing. 

When you use the search bar to filter your displayed submissions, the search function compares your input to any one element (or field) that is on a form and displays every submission that contains that matching element, as you typed it, but is not case-sensitive. The portion you searched for will appear highlighted in blue. Search will not produce any results that are *close* to what you typed if there is a misspelling or if only part matches.

By default, your search results are displayed in order by the submission t hat has had the last action taken (this can be altered in "Filters", under "Sort By"). 

If you have other filters, like "Status" or "Form," selected, it will only search and produce results for those filtered categories. *So, be sure to clear your filters before a new search.*

**Common Search Bar "Gotchas"**
- Commas, decimals, apostrophes, and other punctuation - these are passed over in the search. For instance, searching for 36.00 will also produce results like, 3600 or 3,600.
- Your search input spans multiple elements of a form. A submission element, or form element, is each individual input box that is on a form to receive the submission data. If you search a phrase that, on the form, is divided out into multiple input boxes, your search may not deliver all the results you are looking for.  
	
	*An example of this:* You enter "Billings, MT" into the search bar. Your search results will only include those submissions that have a submission element that contains, "Billings, MT" in one input box. But, it would not include those submissions that contain one form element of "Billings" and/or a second form element that is "MT".
- What you searched for isn't highlighted anywhere on the presented submission results. This is probably because your *Display* option is set to "Collapse All" and the form element that matches your search is only visible in expanded view. Select the "Expand All" display option from the header, or click "show more" on the individual submission.
- Did we mention that you should make sure your filters are cleared before starting a new search? :) The most common reason to not receive the proper search results is that you have a filter set that you didn't realize was still active, therefore limiting your search's data set.

#### Submission Count 
When viewing your submissions management panel with the filters cleared, the total number of submissions that include you will be displayed at the right end of the search bar. This "Submission Count" is the total number of submissions that apply to you and are available to you for search/filter. Every filter that is applied that excludes submission criteria from your search will be reflected in the submission count that is displayed. Your submission count is also displayed when accessing the "Filters" menu.

### Export

The "{{icon:chart-bar size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Export" button, located on the right side of the Submissions Management Panel, above the search bar, allows you to download any form's submissions as a csv file. In order to initiate an export of data, you must, at minimum, [[#Filters|filter]] your submissions by form. If any further narrowing of your data set is desired, select those criteria from "Filters" as well. Once the desired data is displayed, click the "Export" link.  If successful, this message will be displayed: 
>Export started successfully. The result will be emailed upon completion. Check your notification center if you do not see the email.

Your export will not work if there is not a form selected as a filter. If that is the case, this message will be displayed:
>Please select at least one form to export

If successful, you will receive an email from Flow Forms, to the email address associated with your Flow Forms account, that contains a link to download your csv file. The size of the file will dictate the speed of its arrival to your inbox. 

All exports you initiate are also available in your "Notification Center." These can be accessed by clicking your user name, in the upper left corner, and selecting  "Notification Center." Any of your requested exports that are ready for download will be listed under "Submission Exports" and are available for download from this location.

### Print 
The button for "{{icon:printer size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Print" (beside "Export" at the top, right corner of the Submissions Management Panel) allows you to download a PDF and print individual, or a selection of, submissions. 

To print a group/category of submissions, use the filtering options to display the desired results, then click the "Print" button to print them all at once. A modal window will appear that displays the number of submissions in that print request along with the options to either "Cancel" or "Start Print Job." To proceed with printing, click the "Start Print Job" button. A download progress bar will keep you informed of the progress of your request and, if successful, a "Download PDF" button will appear. Click to access the PDF and print. The modal also offers access to "Recent Print Jobs" that you have requested with the option to download them again.

To print a single submission, or select submissions, from your search results, select the desired submission/s by clicking their individual select box (to the left of the form's title in the submission's header). When what you want is selected (a check-mark is displayed), proceed with clicking "Print" and follow the above instructions. 
To exclude only a few submissions from a search display for printing, you can "Select All" by checking the select box that is directly above, in the "Bulk Actions Toolbar," and then unselect those you wish to exclude.

You also have the option to print an individual submission by clicking the gear icon ({{icon:cog-6-tooth size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}), found on the right side of that submission's header and navigate to "Print" or "Download as PDF" from the slide-out menu bar.

### Filters
Flow Forms provides comprehensive filtering options to find exactly what you need.  

To access the complete filter menu, click the blue "{{icon:adjustments-horizontal size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Filter" button in the submission management panel. A slide-out menu will present from the right side of the screen. If any filters are currently active, there will be a "Clear All" button available at the top. Clear the filters if you are starting a new search. Your [[#Submission Count|Submission Count]] is displayed at the top of this menu as well, beside "Filters," and will adjust in accordance with any filters you select. 

Apply multiple filters in concert to narrow your search results. Choose from any of these filtering options:
- Forms
- Terms
- Flow Step
- Date Range
- Status
- Submitted By
- Pending On
- Participants
- Submissions Without a Process

#### Forms
Display and search only the submissions from selected forms. Select the form/s to include in your search from the drop-down box that says, "Select forms to filter," or type the form's name/title into the search bar, which will appear within the drop-down box, and select from the results. A check-mark will appear beside any form that is selected for filtering. To un-select a form, click it a second time and the check-mark indicator will disappear. 

After your desired form/s are selected from the drop-down menu, the number of forms you've selected for search are displayed in the drop-down box.

When a form is selected as a filter, that form's title will also appear on the submission management panel, beside "{{icon:document-duplicate size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Forms." From the submission management panel, you then have the option to click the "X," listed with that form title, to cease filtering by that form. 

Click "Apply Filters" to view your search results.



#### Terms

Choosing to filter by "Terms" allows you to display submissions that have a particular response to a specific form element. 
To do so, you must first select to filter by that [[#Forms|form]]. When at least one form is selected, "Terms" will appear as a filtering option just below the "Forms" drop-down box. When you click, "Add Term," a new drop-down box presents every form element that is included in the form/s you have selected. 

When a form element is selected from the drop-down list, you will only be searching that selected form element for your specified term. Your search will not include any data that is received from any of the other form elements. 

If the form element is a text input, a box for you to type the term you wish to filter for will appear that says, "Enter search value." 
If it is a radio, select, or checkbox style form element, then the box will be a drop-down (with search option) that contains the input options available for that specific form element.

Once the term or terms are specified, click the blue "+ Add Term" button and your criteria will be displayed, listing both the form element you selected and the term you entered. These can be cancelled by clicking the "X" beside your term selection, or by clearing the filters.

*For example:  I have selected a form called, "Client List," from the "Forms" filter option. So, when I click "Add Term"  and select the drop-down box, every form element that is on the "Client List" form, such as: Business name, Contact name, Phone number, Address, etc., appears as an option.  If I select the form element, "Address," and then type, "Montana," in the new text box that appears, I am selecting for my search results to display only clients that have "Montana" in the address category.*


#### Flow Step


#### Start date / End date
If you want to display the submissions from a certain period of time, choose to filter by date. From the filter menu, click in the box below "Start Date," where the current date is displayed in gray, and either type in the 8 digit date (2 digit month, 2 digit day, 4 digit year), or select the date from the calendar, that marks the beginning of your search range.
Repeat that process for the "End Date" of your search and click "Apply Filters" to view your submission results. 

The submissions displayed will be based on the date they were submitted. *If you have a form that has a date as one of its form elements, such as, "Invoice date," and would like to filter for that, you will need to use the "[[Terms]]" filter instead.*

#### Sort By


#### Submission Status 
Display and search submissions that share the status or statuses you select.

The color-coded bar at the top of each submission indicates the status of that particular submission as it progresses through its workflow toward approval/acceptance. Not every status is utilized in every form, but the exhaustive list is as follows: 
		
- Blue - Approved (submission is complete)
- Yellow- Pending (waiting on another's action)
- Red - Pending on Me (waiting on your action)
- Orange - Sent Back (submission has been sent back to the form's originator)
- Magenta - Info Requested (sent back to any flow-step for additional information)
- Gray- Denied (submission has been rejected and cannot be continued)
- Teal - Escalated (skipped flow-step(s) to seek input/approval)


Once your filtering selections are complete, click the *"Apply Filters"* button to see your results. For frequently accessed search criteria, you have the option to save a filter and name it accordingly.



### Clear Filters 
Any time a filter of any type is active, the option to *"Clear Filters"* will appear on the control panel, to the right of the *"Filters"* button, beside the search bar. This removes **all** active filters and restores the presentation of the full list of submissions available to you.  


### Quick-Filters
Two of the most commonly used filters, *"Forms"* and *"Status,"*  are easily accessible from their links on the control panel. When any of those filters are selected, they will appear on the submissions header, below the search bar, with the option to "X" out of any that you would like to remove from filtering.


### Display Options
The submissions header also includes two clickable icons to switch between two display options:
#### "Collapse All" {{icon:arrows-pointing-in size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}

Display an overview of the submission's elements that have been selected as pertinent at the time of the form's creation. This view option displays attachments as thumbnails and/or viewing links. 
	
#### "Expand All" {{icon:arrows-pointing-out size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}
	
Fully display all of the submission's data including an expanded view of  attachments in some formats (png, jpeg). 

*Note - You can change the view of an individual submission rather than apply that view to the whole page. Expand an individual submission that is collapsed by clicking the "show more" button in that submission's header and, conversely, collapse an expanded submission by clicking its "show less" button. 
Additionally, see "Show More" button and "Show Less" button in the Submission View section below.*




### Submission View

Navigate to any of the entries that have populated below the Submission Page header to view a form's submission data. 

The header of every individual submission displays:
- Form Title/Name - click to start a new submission of that form type 
- Name of the submitter
- "Edit" icon - if permission to edit is allowed, you may alter the inputs and add data/comments to the submission
- "History" button - View every action that has been taken on that submission so far. *You may also choose to "show conditional steps" for a more in-depth insight into the flow's parameters (not interesting to most of us)* 
- Status of the submission - if not "Approved," it will list on whom it is pending
- Time the submission was created
- Time the submission was last updated
- Gear icon for "Options" -
- "Pop-out" {{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} - fully view a single submission on a reloaded page.
- "Show More" button - fully view all data/entries on the form while remaining on your "Submissions" page. Also referred to as *Expanded View*
	- *Most attached documents (ex: .png, .jpeg) will also expand in view. PDFs will display a "view PDF" link in order to view the attachment in a modal window. Alternatively, you can click the attachment's link below it to download the attached document or photo.*
- "Show Less" button - return to the overview display of that submission (appears when in the expanded/"show more" view). Also referred to as *Collapsed View*
- "+ Add Note" button - add additional information, comments, or attach files for the record. (Button appears at the bottom of each submission's window and also in the header when in expanded view. When viewing a full submission from the "Pop-out" option, *Notes* appear in a column on the right of the submission data with the most recent at the top. This view also includes the option to "hide notes.") 
	- *When adding a note, you can optionally select permitted users to be notified of your addition. If you do not wish to notify a user that is selected, click their info from the dropdown to unselect them. If there are no notifications selected, the drop down box will display "No Users." You can also save your note as a draft and close*
- "View all notes" button - displays all notes submitted along with user name and time stamp (appears beside the "Add Note" button at the bottom of the submission's window when other notes exist).
