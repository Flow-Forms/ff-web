# Submission View

Navigate to any of the entries that have populated below the Submissions Management Panel to view individual form submissions.

## Submission Header
The header of every individual submission displays:
- **Form Status** - The color-coded bar across the top of each submission's header indicates the status of that particular submission as it progresses through its workflow toward approval/acceptance. Not every status is utilized in every form, but the exhaustive list is as follows: 
		
	- Blue - **Approved** (submission is complete)
	- Yellow- **Pending** (waiting on another's action)
	- Red - **Pending on Me** (waiting on your action)
	- Orange - **Sent Back** (submission has been sent back to the form's originator)
	- Magenta - **Info Requested** (sent back to any flow-step for additional information)
	- Gray- **Denied** (submission has been rejected and cannot be continued)
	- Teal - **Escalated** (skipped flow-step(s) to seek input/approval)
- **Form Title/Name** - Click to start a new submission of that form type. 
- **Submitted By** - Name of the user that submitted the form, along with a color-coded box (auto-assigned) containing their initials.
- **{{icon:pencil-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Edit)** - If permission to edit is allowed, you may alter the inputs and add data/comments to the submission. *If desired, a form's contributors can receive a notification when a form has been edited.*
- **"History" button** - View every action that has been taken on that submission so far. *You may also choose to "show conditional steps" for a more in-depth insight into the flow's parameters (not interesting to most of us).* 
- **Final Status or Pending on** - If not listed as "Approved" or "Denied," a color-coded box, or boxes, with the initials of the user/s on whom the submission is pending will appear. If it is pending on a single user, their full name will be presented alongside. If there are multiple user actions pending, you can click the boxes of their initials to view a modal window that lists the full names of the users that have actions still required for the submission to reach approval.
- **Time stamp(s)** -  While still pending, only the date and time the submission was created is listed. When the submission has reached finality, whether through approval or denial, the date and time of its completion, or when it was last edited, is listed as well. 
- **{{icon:cog-6-tooth size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Options)** -
- **{{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out)** - fully view a single submission on a reloaded page.
- "Show More" button - fully view all data/entries on the form while remaining on your "Submissions" page. Also referred to as *Expanded View*
	- *Most attached documents (ex: .png, .jpeg) will also expand in view. PDFs will display a "view PDF" link in order to view the attachment in a modal window. Alternatively, you can click the attachment's link below it to download the attached document or photo.*
- "Show Less" button - return to the overview display of that submission (appears when in the expanded/"show more" view). Also referred to as *Collapsed View*
- "+ Add Note" button - add additional information, comments, or attach files for the record. (Button appears at the bottom of each submission's window and also in the header when in expanded view. When viewing a full submission from the "Pop-out" option, *Notes* appear in a column on the right of the submission data with the most recent at the top. This view also includes the option to "hide notes.") 
	- *When adding a note, you can optionally select permitted users to be notified of your addition. If you do not wish to notify a user that is selected, click their info from the dropdown to unselect them. If there are no notifications selected, the drop down box will display "No Users." You can also save your note as a draft and close*
- "View all notes" button - displays all notes submitted along with user name and time stamp (appears beside the "Add Note" button at the bottom of the submission's window when other notes exist).
