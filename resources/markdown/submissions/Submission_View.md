# Submission View

From the "{{icon:paper-clip size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Submissions" page, navigate to any of the entries that have populated below the Control Panel to view individual form submissions. Submissions are listed with up to 20 per page. There is a forward/backward button at the bottom of the page for access to any additional pages of filtered results/submissions.

## Submission Header
The header of each submission contains all of the controls, status indicators, and options available for you to understand and directly interact with a submission. 

These include:


### Form Status - 
The color-coded bar across the top of each submission's header indicates the status of that particular submission as it progresses through its workflow toward completion. Not every status is utilized in every form, but the exhaustive list is as follows: 
	
- Blue - **Approved** (submission is complete)
- Yellow- **Pending** (waiting on another's action)
- Red - **Pending on Me** (waiting on your action)	
- Orange - **Sent Back** (submission has been sent back to the form's originator)
- Magenta - **Info Requested** (sent back to any flow-step for additional information)
- Gray- **Denied** (submission has been rejected and cannot be continued)
- Teal - **Escalated** (skipped flow-step(s) to seek input/approval)

### Form Title / Name - 
Click to start a new submission of that form type. 

### Submitted By - 
Name of the user that submitted the form, along with a color-coded box (auto-assigned) containing their initials.

### {{icon:pencil-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Edit) -
If a form's permissions have been set to allow editing, you may alter the inputs and add data/comments to the input areas of a submission that has already been submitted. 

When a submission has been edited, a note is added in that submission's "Notes" log that lists the editor's user name and the time it was edited, along with the message, *"This submission has been edited."* This is accessible from the submission's **{{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} View All Notes** button or while fully viewing a single submission via the **{{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out)** button.

If desired, a form's contributors can receive a notification when a form has been edited. This is initiated by an admin and set up in the form's flow steps.

### History - 
View every action that has been taken on that submission so far. When selected, a modal will display the **Process History.**
- **Action By**- lists the user's name
- **Action**- displays the kind of action they took on the form
- **Date**- specifies the date and timestamp of that action

*You may also choose to **show conditional steps** for a more in-depth insight into the flow's parameters (not interesting to most of us).*

### Actions / Continue
#### Actions:
From the **Submissions** page, when a submission is **Pending On Me** for viewing and approval, but there are no requirements to contribute additional data or input for the continued progress of the form, the blue, **Actions** button will appear beside **History.**

Clicking **Actions** opens a slide-out menu from the right side of your screen with **Available Actions** at the top.  Next, the submission data will appear listed with clickable links for viewing and downloading any attached documents or photos. Below the submission data, the options for your action on the form are presented with color coded buttons. 

*When viewing a full submission on its own page, from the **{{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out)** icon, or from a direct email link to that submission, the action buttons appear at the bottom of the submission, and there is no **Action** or **Continue** button to access them.

- **Approve** - You have viewed and are satisfied with the submission data and are allowing it to proceed with your approval. There are two "Approval plus" options if you click on the {{icon:chevron-down size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} icon that is on the right end of the Approve button.
	- *Approve & View* - Approves the submission, then opens the full submission in its own window for convenient other steps like downloading or printing.
	- *Approve & Print* - Approves the submission, 
	
- **Request Info** - You need additional information from another user, that has a role in the form's flow, before proceeding with your approval. 
	When selected, **Send to** will appear below the action buttons with a drop down box labeled *"Select recipient."* Click to see a list of the available users in the flow. Select their name, and it will appear in the box. 
	
	Below that, the **Message** box allows you to type your communication for the requested information. 
	
	Click the purple **Request Info** button to proceed, or **Cancel** to go back to the **Available Actions** menu without submitting the request. 
	
	Once the **Request Info** option is selected, the submission will then be pending on the user that you requested the information from until the request is addressed. An email will send to that user, with your **Message**, and a link to the submission. If they "reply" directly from their email, their response will be entered into the **Notes** log for that submission. They can also follow the link and reply on the submission directly, which will populate a text box for their reply. As the user that initially requested the information, you will be notified, via email, when the response is received and the submission will return to being pending on the you, the requestor, for continued action.

-  **Send Back -** THIS IS NOT RIGHT, PENDING TALK WITH ANDY This will cause the submission to return to the initial submitter/owner of the form and it will then be pending on their action for the submission to progress toward finalization. This is useful if the submitter entered something incorrectly or information was incomplete. 
	
	When selected, a **Message** text box will appear for you to explain why it is being sent back. You must enter a message in order to select the final **Send Back** button. You can also click **Cancel** to return to the **Available Actions** menu. 
	
	When **Send Back** is selected, the form's submitter will receive an email to notify them of your action that includes your message and a link to the submission. When the form's submitter addresses the issue and submits their input, the flow-steps restart. any approvals or additions

- **Deny -** If, for whatever reason, a form cannot be approved or corrected, you can choose to **Deny** it. This will end its pending status and set the final status as **Denied.** When selected, a **Message** text box will appear for you to enter details for the denial. You must enter a message in order to select the red **Deny** button to submit. You can also **Cancel** to return to the other **Available Actions.** 

	When the submission is denied, an email, that contains your message, will send to the form's submitter to notify them of the denial. This is by default, but, if desired, the form can be made to notify any, or all, of the other users that were contributors to the form in its flow. The data of the denied form will still be accessible and viewable since it has not been deleted. 
	
	An administrator has the ability to select **{{icon:arrow-uturn-left size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Undo Denied**. This will cause the submission to return to the user that took the last action. It will be pending on them again, as if their **Deny** action did not happen.

### Final Status or Pending on - 
If not listed as **Approved** or **Denied,** a color-coded box, or boxes, with the initials of the user/s on whom the submission is pending will appear. 

If it is pending on a single user, their full name will be presented alongside. 

If there are multiple user actions pending, you can click the boxes, containing their initials, to view a modal window that lists the full names of the users that have actions still required for the submission to complete the required steps in its flow and be finalized.

### Time stamp(s) -  
While still pending, only the date and time the submission was created is listed. When the submission has reached finality, whether through approval or denial, the date and time of its completion, or when it was last edited, is listed as well. 

### {{icon:cog-6-tooth size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Options) -
Clicking the gear icon in a submission's header presents you with a side-bar from the right of your screen titled **Submission Options.** Just below that, the name/title of the form is listed along with its Submission ID (starts with "#sub_" followed by a string of letters and numbers that are unique to that submission). The menu below that lists the available options you have for interacting with that submission. These vary greatly by the user's permissions and the submission selected. 

Options you may be presented with are as follows: 

- #### + Add Note
	 
	Add collaboration notes and comments to a submission. Selecting **+ Add Note** from the Options menu opens directly to the notes creation modal. 
	*See the main **+ Add Note** section below, under its own heading, for more information on adding notes.*

- #### {{icon:share size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Share
	Unless a form is set up as "private," as the owner/submitter of a form, or as an administrator, you have the ability to share a particular submission, or all your submissions on a particular form, with another Flow Forms user. This is only granting viewing permission and does not allow the shared-with-user to take any actions on the submission. Adding notes is permitted for anyone with viewing permissions on a form.

	Choosing **{{icon:share size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Share** under the **{{icon:cog-6-tooth size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Options)** menu opens a modal that presents you with a searchable, drop-down box of users labeled, **Select User to Share Submissions With.** Select a user's name and a checkmark will appear beside their info and their name and email address will appear in the drop-down box. 

	Under this, there is a select-box that lets you choose from two ways of sharing: 
	- **Only this submission** - Allows your selected user to view *only the single submission* from which you navigated.
	- **All submissions on this form** - Choosing this will allow your selected user to view *every submission you have made to the form* from which you navigated, not just the single submission. 

	If previous sharing has been set, those details are presented at the bottom of the modal with a differentiation made between the two types of sharing: **This submission only,** or **All submissions on this form.** If none exist, *"Not shared with anyone"* will be displayed.
	
	Once you click the blue, **Share** button, your new sharing selection will appear in this section. Other users can be added, one at a time, for additional sharing. If you would like to remove access that you have granted in this manner, select the **{{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}(trash)** icon beside their user info and a prompt will appear that asks, *"Are you sure you want to remove sharing with this user?"* Click **Cancel** to exit without removing or **OK** to remove and stop allowing that user to view a submission or all your submissions for that form.
	

	***Advanced Sharing:*** Clicking the blue, **Advanced sharing** link under the sharing options select-box takes you to additional sharing options for you as a user. 

	From the **Sharing** modal, you may select to turn on a toggle switch labeled, **All Submissions.** Do this if you would like to designate a user to be allowed to view *all* your submissions to *all* of your forms. When this is switched **on,** the only remaining selection is a drop-down box, with search capability, labeled, **Share with Selected Users.** From this, you may select the user's name with whom you would like to share your viewing permissions. A checkmark will appear beside their name once selected, and will also appear in the drop-down box. Click the blue, **Save** button to submit this new share or "X" out of the modal to exit without saving.

	When the **All Submissions** toggle switch is set to **off,** you are left with two, searchable, drop-down boxes. 
	- **Submissions From Selected Forms -** lists all the forms you are included in. Select the form you'd like to share, a checkmark will appear beside it, and the form name will appear in the drop-down box. 
	- **Share with Selected Users -** Select the user you'd like to grant access to that form, and their name will appear in the box. This allows the user viewing access to all your submissions, but only on the specified form. 
	
	Click the blue, **Save** button to activate the new share, or the **X** to exit without saving.

	Any prior selections for sharing will appear at the bottom of the modal, under their category of either, **Individual Shared Submission** or **Submissions Shared by Form.** These are listed with the user's name that is being shared with, and the number of forms that are being shared with them.  To see the listing of forms shared, click the user's name and the form name/s will populate below with the **{{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}(trash)** icon beside each of them. Click the trash icon to delete the sharing for that form. A window will appear asking, *"Are you sure you want to delete this share?"* Click **Cancel** to exit without deleting the share or **OK** to proceed with deleting and cease sharing on that form. 

	When there is no sharing set up on any of your forms, in the modal, under **Individual Shared Submissions** it will say, *"No submissions individually."* And under **Submissions Shared by Form** it will say, *"No submissions shared by form."*




- #### {{icon:calendar size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Reminders  
	***Use Case:** I need to be reminded to follow up on this next week* 
	
	If you would like an email and/or text message to be sent to you, at a specific time, linking to a submission, select **{{icon:calendar size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Reminders** from the Options menu of that submission. A modal will appear with these options:
	- **When** - set the date for the reminder, or for when the reminders are to begin
	- **Frequency** - 
		- *One Time* - for one reminder, sent one time (on date set above)
		- *Recurring* - Select for reminders to be sent at an interval of your choosing
			- **Interval** - number of units between reminders
			- **Frequency** - unit of time (day, week, month, year)
			- **Ends** - 
				- *Never* - Select to have reminders continue in perpetuity
				- *On* - Select to end reminders on a specified date (date selection box appears when "On" is selected)
				- *After* - Select for reminders to end after a certain number have been sent. When selected, an "Occurrences" box appears to allow the number of reminders to be selected.
	-  **Trigger** - A trigger is an action that is auto-deployed at the time of a set occurrence in a form's flow. If, at the time of the form's flow design, a trigger has been created, it will appear here as an option to deploy that trigger at the time specified by your reminder. Both the trigger's action and your reminder communication will occur when this is selected from reminders.
	-  **Message** - Type your desired communication for the reminder in this section. It will be sent as your reminder message via email, and SMS if selected, along with abbreviated submission info and a link to the submission.
	-  **Send SMS** - Toggle button is off by default. Click to turn on if a text message reminder is desired, in addition to the default email notification. 
	- **Current Reminders** - If any reminders are already set on the submission, they will appear here, listed with their "Type" and "Message." If there are none, "No reminders set" will appear. You can set multiple reminders on a submission.
	- Click "Cancel" to exit reminders or click "Add Reminder" to set your reminder with the parameters you have selected.

- #### Transfer
- #### Reassign to Me

- #### {{icon:printer size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Print
	If you select to print from the Options menu, the submission will be reloaded on its own page, from which you see the full, individual submission for printing. 

- #### Custom View

- #### {{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Download as PDF 
	Instantly downloads the submission, as a PDF, to your device.

- #### {{icon:document-duplicate size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Copy Submission  
	
	Selecting to copy a submission loads a copy of the same form submission on a new page with a copy of that submission's data already loaded. The submission is then ready for any alterations or additions for it to be submitted anew as its own submission. This is convenient if you have multiple very similar form submissions to create and don't want to have to enter redundant information.
	
	***Use Case**: I want to create a similar submission without re-entering all of the data.


- #### {{icon:arrow-path size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Restart Submission 
	
	If you are the owner/submitter of a form, or an administrator, you have the option to restart a submission. This takes you to a page with the selected form submission reloaded, but not yet submitted. If you have any alterations or additions to make, you can do so before clicking the blue, "Submit" button at the bottom. 
	
	This restarts your submission at the beginning of its flow and any actions that had already been taken will have to be completed again for it to reach approval/completion.
	
	***Use Case:** This submission needs to start completely over.*  **CANNOT BE UNDONE**


- #### {{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Delete Submission
	As the owner/submitter of a form, or an administrator, you may delete a submission by selecting **{{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Delete Submission** from the **{{icon:cog-6-tooth size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Options)** menu of that submission. A modal will appear that says, *"Are you sure you want to delete this submission? This action cannot be undone."* It then lists the name of the form, its submission ID, and the time it was created. Select **Cancel** to exit without deleting, or the red, **Delete Submission** button to delete the submission. Choosing to delete is a permanent action, and that submission ID and data will be unable to be recovered.

- #### {{icon:arrow-uturn-left size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Undo Approved / Denied
	This is used to reverse an approved or denied decision. This is an Admin-only emergency function to reverse terminal state (approved/denied) decisions. The last action is undone and the submission will be pending on the user responsible for the last flow-step in order to be processed again.
	
	***Use Case***- A submission was approved/denied by mistake and needs to be reversed.
	
	When selected, a modal will open with **Undo Submission Approved/Denied** at the top. The **Process History** is listed next with **Step,  

 - #### {{icon:envelope size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Resend Email
	 Select this to resend a notification email to the currently assigned user/s. This sends to all users that have active notifies on this submission, but has a rate limit to prevent redundancy/abuse. 
	 
	 ***Use Case***- The assigned users didn't receive the email or it was lost/deleted.
	 
	 

### {{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out) - 
Fully view a single submission on a reloaded page.  From the reloaded page, you can click the "{{icon:arrow-uturn-left size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Previous Page" link, just above the submission's header on its left end, to return to your submissions page as you left it.

### {{icon:arrows-pointing-out size-5 inline-block align-text-center}} Show More - 
Fully view all data/entries on the form submission while remaining on your "Submissions" page. Also referred to as *Expanded View.*
- Most attached documents (ex: .png, .jpeg) will also expand in view. PDFs will display a "view PDF" link in order to view the attachment in a modal window. Alternatively, you can click the attachment's link, just below it, to download the attached document or photo.

### {{icon:arrows-pointing-in size-5 inline-block align-text-center}} Show Less - 
Return to the overview display of the submission's data. The elements displayed in this view are selected at the time of the form's creation. This view option displays attachments as thumbnails and/or viewing links. This button only appears when in the expanded, or, "show more" view, and is also referred to as *Collapsed View.*

### + Add Note - 
Add additional information, comments, or attach files for the record. Notes are visible to anyone with access to the submission, but can be set to "protected" when you need only a group of users to be able to view them. The "+ Add Note" button appears at the bottom of each submission's window and also in the header when in expanded view. 

To add a note:
1. Click the "+ Add Note" button and a modal window will appear over the top of the submission. 
	- If other notes have already been submitted, the most recent will appear in a grayed out box that says, "Most Recent Note," along with the name of the user that submitted it and how long ago it was added. *If the displayed note is of a certain length, it will appear truncated with the option to select a "+ read more" and, conversely, a "- read less" button for you to toggle between according to your preference.* 
	- If more than one note has been added, there will be a button at the top of the modal that gives you the option to "{{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} View All Notes." If you want every note to be displayed for your review, click "{{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} View All Notes." A slide-out column will present from the right side of your screen that lists all the notes, along with their submitter's name and the time of the note's addition, in order, with the most recent addition at the top.  Click the "X  Close" button in the top right corner of the slide-out to return to your "Notes" modal window.
2. Next, you can optionally select permitted users to be notified of your notes addition. 
	- By default, the person that was the form's submitter will be selected for notification when a note is added, and their name and email address will be displayed in the dropdown box under the label, "Notify Selected Users." 
	- If you click the box, the dropdown will display all users that are included in the flow-steps for that form, along with a search bar. Scroll through, or search, for the user/s you would like to add or remove. 
	- Clicking any user's name will add a checkmark beside their info to indicate they have been selected for notification.  If you do not wish to notify a user that is selected, click their name to unselect them, and the checkmark will disappear. 
	- If there are no users selected for notification, the drop down box will display "No Users." 
3. After that, proceed to the "Message" text box and input your note content. 
	- You can additionally select the "{{icon:folder-plus size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Attach File" button, located just above the right side of the "Message" text box, and choose files from your device to attach to your note. 
		- Once an attachment is uploaded, it will appear below the "Message" text box, under "Attachments." The attachment can be downloaded by clicking its link. You also have the option to delete the attachment by clicking the red, trash can ({{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}) icon.
4. When your note is complete, click the blue, "Add Note" button to submit. Any users selected for notification will be sent an email notifying them of your note addition at this time. 
	- If you need to navigate away from the notes modal, and would like to return to submit your note later, click the "Save Draft and Close" button. 
	- If you have chosen to save your draft, your note, as you left it, will reappear in the "Notes" modal window when you click the "+ Add Note" button on that submission again. 
	- Clicking out of the modal, or clicking the "X" in the top, right-hand corner of the modal, exits you out of the "Notes" modal without submitting your note. However, your note will still be saved as a draft and accessible in the same manner as a draft. 
	- To discard/delete a note that you have not submitted, click the "Discard Draft" button in the bottom, left-hand corner of the modal.
	
	
- When viewing a full submission on its own page (from the "{{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out)" option), "Notes" appear in a column to the right of the submission data window with the most recent note displayed at the top. Click the "+ Add Note" button to contribute a new note. 
	- This view also includes the option to "hide notes" by clicking that link just above the notes column. When notes are hidden, an "{{icon:eye size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}" button will appear in the upper right corner. Click this button to show the notes column again.
	
- **{{icon:document-text size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} View All Notes** - displays all notes submitted along with user name and time stamp. This button will appear beside the **+ Add Note** button at the bottom of the submission's window when other notes exist.

- **Deleting Your Notes** -  When viewing all notes from the slide-out column, or the {{icon:arrow-top-right-on-square size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} (Pop-out) view, any note you contributed will appear with a trash can ({{icon:trash size-4 inline-block align-text-center}}) icon beside it that allows you to delete any note you contributed. Admin can also delete notes added by any user.
