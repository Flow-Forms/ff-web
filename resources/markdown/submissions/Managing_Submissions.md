# Somehow I Manage... Submissions

View, organize, and manage form submissions efficiently with Flow Forms' powerful submission management tools.

All form submissions that you have permission to access are available to view from the "Submissions" page. Click "{{icon:paper-clip size-4 inline-block align-text-center}} Submissions" from the sidebar to begin.

*Note - It is also an option to click "clear filters" when accessing the Submissions page from the sidebar. Flow Forms automatically saves and displays your last search and/or filtered result, making for easy access to frequently needed info. If you know you are starting a new search, clicking "clear filters" from the sidebar is a time-saving nicety that prevents having to "Clear Filters" after your submissions page loads.*


## Management Panel
At the top of your submissions page is the Submissions Management Panel that will remain at the top of the display as you interact with your submissions down the page. This space contains the search bar and all the filter functions, export and print options, as well as the controls to change the display view and sort order. 

The bottom of the management panel is made up of the "Bulk Actions Toolbar" that allows you to take actions for a group of submissions rather than dealing with them individually.  *(This portion will only remain in view as you scroll down the page if there is at least one submission selected.)*

Below the management panel, an abbreviated display (20 entries per page) of **all** form submissions you are authorized to interact with is listed, in order, by the submission that has had the most recent action taken. This is by default, and can be filtered for viewing in many ways.
