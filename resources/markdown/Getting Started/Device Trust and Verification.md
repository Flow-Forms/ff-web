# Device Trust & Verification  
  
To help protect your account, we track the devices you use to sign in. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring verification when you (or someone else) attempts to access your account from an unrecognized device.

## How It Works  
  
### Your First Sign-In  
  
When you first create your account or sign in for the first time, your device is automatically registered as a trusted device. No additional verification is required.  
  
### Signing In From a New Device  
  
When you sign in from a device we don't recognize, you'll be asked to verify your identity:  
  
1. **Choose your verification method** - Select whether to receive a code via email or text message (if you have a verified phone number)  
2. **Enter the 6-digit code** - Check your email or text messages for the verification code  
3. **Device is now trusted** - Once verified, you won't need to verify this device again  
  
### What Triggers Verification?  
  
A new verification is required when:  
- You sign in from a new browser or device  
- You clear your browser cookies  
- Your trusted device expires  
- You or an administrator removes the device from the trusted list  
  
## Managing Your Devices  
  
You can view and manage your trusted devices from your profile settings:  
  
1. Go to **Settings** > **Edit Profile**  
2. Click **Manage Devices**  
3. You'll see a list of all your trusted devices, including:  
   - Device name (browser and operating system)  
   - Location (city and country)  
   - Last time the device was used  
   - Which device you're currently using  
  
### Removing a Device  
  
If you no longer use a device or suspect unauthorized access:  
  
1. Find the device in your device list  
2. Click the **Remove** button next to it  
3. The device will immediately lose access and require re-verification on next sign-in  
  
You can also **Remove All Other Devices** to sign out everywhere except your current device.  
  
## Security Tips  
  
- **Review your devices regularly** - If you see a device you don't recognize, remove it immediately and change your password  
- **Sign out on shared computers** - Always sign out when using a public or shared computer  
- **Keep your contact info updated** - Ensure your email and phone number are current so you can receive verification codes  
  
## Frequently Asked Questions  
  
**Q: Why am I being asked to verify my device?**  
A: This happens when we detect a sign-in from a device we don't recognize. This could be a new device, a different browser, or after clearing your cookies.  
  
**Q: I'm on my regular device but being asked to verify. Why?**  
A: This can happen if you cleared your browser cookies, your browser updated in a way that changed its fingerprint, or if your trusted device expired after 1 year.  
  
**Q: What if I don't receive the verification code?**  
A: Check your spam/junk folder for emails. For text messages, ensure your phone number is correct in your profile. You can also try the "Resend Code" option after the cooldown period.  
  
**Q: How long does a device stay trusted?**  
A: Trusted devices remain active for 1 year from the date they were verified. After that, you'll need to verify again.  
  
**Q: Can I see where my account has been accessed from?**  
A: Yes, the device manager shows the approximate location (city and country) for each trusted device.
