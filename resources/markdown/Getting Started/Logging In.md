# Logging In

Your first interaction with Flow Forms will be the login page. We offer multiple ways to access your account:

## Standard Login

Enter your email address and password, then click "Sign In" to access your dashboard.

## Password Reset

Forgot your password? No problem:

1. Click the "Reset Password" link on the login page
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for a reset link
4. Click the link and choose your new password
5. You'll be redirected to login with your new credentials

## Passwordless Login

Sign in without a password:

1. Click "Sign in without a password"
2. Choose email or phone number authentication
3. Enter your email or phone number and click "Send Link"
4. Check for a magic link (email) or text message (SMS)
5. Click the link to instantly log in (valid for 30 minutes)

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

If your organization uses SSO (like Google), the password reset option won't be available. Contact your system administrator for password assistance.
